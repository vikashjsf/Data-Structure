/*

Bitwise AND is a binary operator (operates on two operands). It's denoted by &.

The & operator compares corresponding bits of two operands. 
	If both bits are 1, it gives 1. If either of the bits is not 1, it gives 0. For example,

12 = 00001100 (In Binary)
25 = 00011001 (In Binary)

Bit Operation of 12 and 25
  00001100
& 00011001
  ________
  00001000  = 8 (In decimal)
